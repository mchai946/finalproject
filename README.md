# Marriage Trends from 1960-2012

### Topic
This project looks at the decline in marriage in the United States from the time period 1960-2012.

### Motivation
I took my data from a [FiveThirty Eight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marriage-isnt-dead-yet/) that stated, "In 1960, nearly 90 percent of 25- to 34-year olds had been married; today, that figure is barely 50 percent." This statistic was intruiging. It's often said that millenials (those that reach young adulthood in the 21st century) have drastically different lifestyles than their parents and grandparents - [more technology use](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/02/millennials-stand-out-for-their-technology-use-but-older-generations-also-embrace-digital-life/), [more money-conscious](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/021914/money-habits-millennials.asp), and [more socially aware](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesgay/2017/08/11/millennials-social-responsibility/#6f05f38617d8). I wanted to see if these different mannerisms carried over into marriage, and how different factors, for instance, education or income level, affected an individual's decision to get married, and how these trends change over time.

### Summary
The data shows that today's young people (ages 25-34) are delaying marriage, and sometimes not getting married at all, when compared to those in the 20th century. All the data showed declines in the percentage of those who have ever been married, but there are three main findings about young people I find particularly interesting.
1. Less educated Americans are less likely to be married, and when they do get married, they're more likely to get divorced than their better-educated counterparts.
2. Working women are less likely to be married than their unemployed counterparts, while the reverse is true for men.
3. Individuals with kids are nearly 4 times more likely to have been married than those without kids.
