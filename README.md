# Marriage Trends from 1960-2012

### Topic
This project looks at the decline in marriage in the United States from the time period 1960-2012.

### Motivation
The [FiveThirty Eight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marriage-isnt-dead-yet/) that I took my data from stated, "In 1960, nearly 90 percent of 25- to 34-year olds had been married; today, that figure is barely 50 percent." This statistic intriguied me. It's often said that millenials have drastically different lifestyles than their parents and grandparents - [more technology use](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/02/millennials-stand-out-for-their-technology-use-but-older-generations-also-embrace-digital-life/), [more money-conscious](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/021914/money-habits-millennials.asp), and [more socially aware](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesgay/2017/08/11/millennials-social-responsibility/#6f05f38617d8). I wanted to see if these unconventional manners carried over into marriage, and how different factors, for instance, education or income level, affected an individual's decision to get married, and how these trends change over time.

### Summary
The data shows that today's young people (ages 25-34) are delaying marriage, and sometimes not getting married at all, when compared to those in the 20th century. All the data showed declines in the percentage of those who have ever been married, but there are three main findings about young people I find particularly interesting.
1. Americans with only a high school degree are seeing the sharpest decline in having been married (when compared to those that have some college education or more). 
2. Given the most recent data, high-school educated Americans are nearly five times more likely to get divorced than college-educated Americans (33% of those with a high school degree or less reported having been divorced, versus 7% of college-educated Americans).
3. Individuals with kids (defined as having at least one child living at home) are nearly 4 times more likely to have been married than those without kids (defined as having none of their own children living at home).
